This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on certain health parameters and historical data. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we can provide an early prediction that can help individuals take preventive measures and seek medical advice proactively.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and other relevant health indicators. It has been preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate predictions.

Model
We have trained a machine learning model using the dataset to predict the probability of an individual developing diabetes. The model has been evaluated using various metrics and techniques to ensure its reliability.

Usage
To use the prediction model, simply input the required health parameters for an individual, and the model will output the likelihood of that person developing diabetes. Feel free to experiment with different inputs and test the accuracy of the predictions.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
